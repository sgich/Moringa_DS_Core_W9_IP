# Data Science Core Independent Project Week 9

## __Classification of Titanic & Email Datasets__ ##


## _Description_ ##

Experimenting using the K-NN and Naive Bayes Classifiers on two different datasets in order to observe their performance. Firstly, the Titanic dataset was used to test the K-NN classifier then Naive Bayes classifier was used on a text vectorized dataset to classify emails as either ham or spam.


## _Platforms Used_ ##
* Google Colab
* Git/GitHub


## _Technologies Used_ ##
* Python
* Pandas Library
* Numpy Library
* Matplotlib Library
* Seaborn Library
* Standard Library
* SciPy Library
* Sci-Kit Library
* Plotly

## _Motivation_ ##
The goal was to observe the performance of the two types of classifiers (K-NN & Naive Bayes) after determining the optimum train/test split, hyperparameters and utilizing model performance enhancements(data reduction, scaling, applying smoothing or not, etc).
